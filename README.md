MopaBootstrapBundle
===================

MopaBootstrapBundle is a collection of code to integrate twitter's bootstrap
(http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) as easy as possible into your symfony2
(http://www.symfony.com) Project.

The Bootstrap 3 support is currently experimentally working, and we are tring to fix issues asap.
Please also try to use it and make PR's!

To use bootstrap 3 in your project add it via [composer](https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/1-installation.md)
and let the Bundle detect version etc, automatically. 
An upgrade to bootstrap 3 should also be as easy as changing your composer.json to use bootstrap 3


Branches
--------

To use this bundle with boostrap 3 use the master branch:

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "mopa/bootstrap-bundle": "dev-master",
        "twbs/bootstrap": "v3.0.0"
    }
}
```

For bootstrap 2 use the v2.3.x branch:

```json
If you want to use bootstrap 2:

{
    "require": {
        "mopa/bootstrap-bundle": "2.3.x-dev",
        "twbs/bootstrap": "v2.3.2"
    }
}
```
To understand which versions are currently required have a look into `BRANCHES.md`

<h4>Tabs</h4>
We need to add more info here

<h4>Bootstrap 3</h4>

We now officially suport bootstrap3 in our master branch, 
The default is to determine Version by composer, this means, MopaBootstrapBundle tries to determine
which version you have installed, and configures itself to use it. This is done in a compiler pass and stored in local cache.
If for any reason this does not wor for you, you might want to set the 

We have several files seperated for bs2 and bs3 to be abled to support both e.g. forms:
 * https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/views/Form/fields_bs_2.html.twig
 * https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/views/Form/fields_bs_3.html.twig
or JS:
 * https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/public/js/eyecon-bootstrap-datepicker.js
 * https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/public/js/eyecon-bootstrap-3-datepicker.js

The bs3 feature set is not yet complete, but we hope that it gets soon, with your help!
E.g Form have some known issues, JS Collections, etc

<h4>Dynamic SubnavBars</h4>

To kick start your Navigation, the Navbar component got some face lift.
It got even easier to integrate also the dynamic sub navbar you might have seen in the twitter bootstrap docs.

To learn how to use this features read [Navbar docs (4-navbar-generation)](https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/4-navbar-generation.md).

Also have a look into the [Sandbox](http://bootstrap.mohrenweiserpartner.de/mopa/bootstrap/navbar)

<h4>initializr</h4>

To make your base HTML5 even better and let you use good practices we added
to this bundle features from [HTML5 BoilerPlate Project](http://html5boilerplate.com/).
Integration was done using setup pregenerated with support of [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/).
Actually we support __HTML5__ __BoilerPlate__ _v3.0.3_ with __Modernizr__ _v2.5.3_ and __Respond__.

To learn how to use this features read [Initializr docs (50-Initializr.md)](https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/50-initializr.md).

Warning
-------

> The branching strategy has been adapted to be more flexible:
> * The old branch for bootstrap 1.x (v1.x) still exists.
> * The v2.0.x (previously v2.x_sf2.0) branch is following Symfony 2.0.x with bootstrap 2.x
> * The master branch is following Symfony master with bootstrap 2.x
> * The master-crud branch is following Symfony master with bootstrap 2.x but still has the CRUD Generator, which depends on SensioGeneratorBundle

Translations
------------
If you use [KnpPaginatorBundle](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpPaginatorBundle) with MopaBootstrapBundle, you can translate labels to your language.
To do this add new file

```sh
Resources/translations/pagination.[YOUR LOCALE CODE].yml
```

As example you have there Polish translation.
