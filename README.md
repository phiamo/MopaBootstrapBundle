MopaBootstrapBundle
===================

MopaBootstrapBundle is a collection of code to integrate twitter's bootstrap
(http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) as easy as possible into your symfony2
(http://www.symfony.com) Project.

To use MopaBootstrapBundle and Twitter Bootstrap 3 in your project add it via [composer](https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/1-installation.md)

To use this bundle with bootstrap 3 use the master branch:

    }
}
```
