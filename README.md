Recently added Features
-----------------------

<h4>Dynamic SubnavBars</h4>

To kick start your Navigation, the Navbar component got some face lift.
It got even easier to integrate also the dynamic sub navbar you might have seen in the twitter bootstrap docs.

To learn how to use this features read [Navbar docs (4-navbar-generation)](https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/4-navbar-generation.md).

Also have a look into the [Sandbox](http://bootstrap.mohrenweiserpartner.de/mopa/bootstrap/navbar)

<h4>initializr</h4>

To make your base HTML5 even better and let you use good practices we added
to this bundle features from [HTML5 BoilerPlate Project](http://html5boilerplate.com/).
Integration was done using setup pregenerated with support of [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/).
Actually we support __HTML5__ __BoilerPlate__ _v3.0.3_ with __Modernizr__ _v2.5.3_ and __Respond__.

To learn how to use this features read [Initializr docs (50-Initializr.md)](https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/50-initializr.md).

Warning
-------

> The branching strategy has been adapted to be more flexible:
> * The old branch for bootstrap 1.x (v1.x) still exists.
> * The v2.0.x (previously v2.x_sf2.0) branch is following Symfony 2.0.x with bootstrap 2.x
> * The master branch is following Symfony master with bootstrap 2.x
> * The master-crud branch is following Symfony master with bootstrap 2.x but still has the CRUD Generator, which depends on SensioGeneratorBundle

Translations
------------
