Css vs. Less
============

Bootstrap is written in [http://lesscss.org](less) and compiled to css.
You can download a pure css distribution from http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

But then you must manage it yourself. e.g.
 - Install it in Ressources/public/
 - use the pure css template

If you want to make use e.g. of mixins, variables etc. you must use less see http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/less.html
There are several ways of including it

- either you let assetic manage the compilation of your less files 
- you use the less js

### Which is faster to kickstart?

Depends on what you want to achieve, and what your knowledge is:

- If you feel good hacking your system, installing newer programs and maintaining your dev environment, 
the recommended way would be to install less.
  You probably should invest the time to get a working setup, and  after that relax, and see less beeing integrated well, and providing what it should.

- If you dont feel comfortable to install additional software and maintain them, and you are not experienced in less, probabaly you could start with css version.

But be warned:

Since less is THE recommended way of working with bootstrap, all css specific instructions may work well or not.
They have at least been tested once and worked in this scenario.

The less way is tested daily and works out to be a flexible fast way of working with all the (also less) dependencies.

For getting less working, there are several documents provided, so the focus here is on the css way:

This is how it could be done without using less features:
hear is a sniplet that is known to be working and was tested
First you have to go from your project directory:

```bash
cd vendor/mopa/bootstrap-bundle/Mopa/BootstrapBundle/Resources/public/bootstrap
make
```

If you get any error have a look into
less-installation.md

If there is still an error like

"TypeError: Cannot call method 'charAt' of undefined"

Check your lessc bins and pathes:

I had this 'charAt' error with
lessc 1.2.1 (LESS Compiler) [JavaScript]
So you need to use a newer lessc version:
lessc 1.3.0 (LESS Compiler) [JavaScript]

so you need to tell your shell which version to use, if you already installed a newer lessc as suposed in less-installation.md

Try:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/lessc/bin:$PATH
```

be warned:

- paginator.less isnt compiled, so its missing
- all less features are not available
- you have to take care for everything yourself!

So here is the final sniplet:
make sure the files have been generated (make):

```jinja
{% stylesheets filter='?yui_css'
    '@MopaBootstrapBundle/Resources/public/bootstrap/docs/assets/css/bootstrap.css'
    '@YourNiceBundle/Resources/public/css/*'
%}
<link href="{{ asset_url }}" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
{% endstylesheets %}
```
