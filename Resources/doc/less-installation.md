MopaBootstrapBundle Less installation
=====================================

To effectively use all features of bootstrap you want to use less together with bootstrap.
Have a look into the following docs what it is and then install it on your system.

 * [Twitters Less Doc](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/extend.html)
 * [Lesscss](http://lesscss.org/)


Installing nodejs and less css manually
------------------------------------

 - node.js: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation
 - npm: (node package manager) 
 
``` bash
curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
```

 - less css:

``` bash
npm install less -g
```

 - configure assetic to make use of it (replace /usr with your prefix)

``` yaml
assetic:
    filters:
        less:
            node: /usr/bin/node
            node_paths: [/usr/lib/node_modules]
            apply_to: "\.less$"
```

 - Yui CSS and CSS Embed are very nice and recommended.
   to make full use of bootstraps capabilites they are not needed, neither is less but its up to you
   see [Assetic configuration](https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/assetic-configuration.md)


Known Problems:
---------------

If you have problems with your less version 
for istance, less 1.2.1 did not work for me with bootstrap 2.0.2
there was an error like:

```
[RuntimeException]                                                           
  TypeError: Cannot call method 'charAt' of undefined

      at /usr/lib/node_modules/less/lib/less/index.js:113:15  
```

another error i had was 

```
  [RuntimeException]                                                                                                                                                                         
  Syntax Error on line 396 in /var/www/virtual/mohrenweiserpartner.de/bootstrap/checkout/vendor/bundles/Mopa/BootstrapBundle/Resources/bootstrap/less/mixins.less        
  395 .reset-filter() {                                                                                                                                                            
  396   filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(enabled = false);                                                                                              
  397 }                            
```

To solve it , i installed a own copy of the less master (currently 1.3.0):

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js.git /opt/lessc
```

and added in config.yml the path before the std path:

```yaml
# Assetic Configuration
assetic:
    debug:          %kernel.debug%
    use_controller: false
    # java: /usr/bin/java
    filters:
        less:
            node: /usr/bin/node
            node_paths: [/opt/lessc/lib, /usr/lib/node_modules] 
    # more to be here, truncated...

```

Strange less compilation
------------------------

If you encounter strange compilation of colors like: NaNbbaaNaN00NaN00NaN00NaN00NaN 
or any NaN in your compiled css files, this is most probably an lessc problem.

Try the above way, but checkout revision fcc50ac8e81f950867402d2e2bb6328ed9cf532a:

``` bash
cd /opt/lessc
git checkout fcc50ac8e81f950867402d2e2bb6328ed9cf532a
```

MAC and MAMP Problems
---------------------

MAMP has some strange settings so you need to find your apache envvars file

/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/envvars

 and comment out the two lines for $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

Without that it seems the dev environment wont be abled to use less in assetic.
